      <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Brief terminology:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><tt><a href="Consumer.html">Consumer</a></tt></dt><dd>The website wanting to verify an <a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a>
identity URL. Sometimes called a &quot;relying party&quot;. If you want
people to log into your site using <a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a>,
then you are the consumer.

</dd>
<dt><tt><a href="Server.html">Server</a></tt></dt><dd>The website which makes assertions as to whether or not the user at the end
of the browser owns the URL they say they do.

</dd>
<dt><tt>Redirect</tt></dt><dd>An HTTP 302 (Temporarily Moved) redirect. When issued as an HTTP response
from the server, the browser changes it&#8217;s location to the value
specified.

</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The <a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a> authentication process requires the
following steps, as visible to the user of this library:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The user enters their <a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a> into a field on
the consumer&#8217;s site, and hits a login button.

</li>
<li>The consumer site discovers the user&#8217;s <a
href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a> server information using the Yadis
protocol (Potentially falling back to <a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a>
1.0 &quot;linkrel&quot; discovery).

</li>
<li>The consumer site prepares a URL to be sent to the server which contains
the <a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a> autentication information, and
issues a redirect user&#8217;s browser.

</li>
<li>The server then verifies that the user owns the URL provided, and sends the
browser a redirect back to the consumer. This redirect contains the
server&#8217;s response to the authentication request.

</li>
</ol>
<p>
The most important part of the flow to note is the consumer&#8217;s site
must handle two separate HTTP requests in order to perform the full
identity check. These two HTTP requests are described in steps 1 and 4
above, and are handled by <a
href="Consumer.html#M000124">Consumer.begin</a> and <a
href="Consumer.html#M000126">Consumer.complete</a> respectively.
</p>
<h2><a href="Consumer.html">Consumer</a> Library Design</h2>
<p>
The library is designed with the above flow in mind. The goal is to make it
as easy as possible to perform the above steps securely.
</p>
<p>
At a high level, there are two important parts in the consumer library. The
first important part is the <a href="Consumer.html">OpenID::Consumer</a>
class, which contains the public interface to the consumer logic. The
second is the <a href="Store.html">OpenID::Store</a> class, which defines
the interface needed to store the state the consumer needs to maintain
between requests.
</p>
<p>
In general, the second part is less important for users of the library to
know about, as several concrete store implementations are provided. The
user simply needs to choose the store which best fits their environment and
requirements.
</p>
<h2>Stores and Dumb Mode</h2>
<p>
<a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a> is a protocol that works best when the
consumer site is able to store some state. This is the normal mode of
operation for the protocol, and is sometimes referred to as smart mode.
There is also a fallback mode, known as dumb mode, which is available when
the consumer site is not able to store state. This mode should be avoided
when possible, as it leaves the implementation more vulnerable to replay
attacks.
</p>
<p>
The mode the library works in for normal operation is determined by the
store that it is given. The store is an abstraction that handles the data
that the consumer needs to manage between HTTP requests in order to operate
efficiently and securely.
</p>
<p>
Several store implementation are provided, and the interface is fully
documented so that custom stores can be used as well. The implementations
that are provided allow the consumer site to store data in a couple of
different ways: in the filesystem, or in an SQL database.
</p>
<p>
There is an additional concrete store provided that puts the consumer in
dumb mode. This is not recommended, as it removes the library&#8217;s
ability to stop replay attacks reliably. It still uses time-based checking
to make replay attacks only possible within a small window, but they remain
possible within that window. This store should only be used if the consumer
site has no way to retain data between requests at all. See <a
href="DumbStore.html">DumbStore</a> for more info.
</p>
<p>
If your ennvironment permits, use of the <a
href="FilesystemStore.html">FilesystemStore</a> is recommended.
</p>
<h2>Immediate Mode</h2>
<p>
If you are new to <a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a>, it is suggested that
you skip this section and refer to it later. Immediate mode is an advanced
consumer topic.
</p>
<p>
In the flow described in the overview, the user may need to confirm to the
identity server that it&#8217;s ok to authorize his or her identity. The
server may draw pages asking for information from the user before it
redirects the browser back to the consumer&#8217;s site. This is generally
transparent to the consumer site, so it is typically ignored as an
implementation detail.
</p>
<p>
There can be times, however, where the consumer site wants to get a
response immediately. When this is the case, the consumer can put the
library in immediate mode. In immediate mode, there is an extra response
possible from the server, which is essentially the server reporting that it
doesn&#8217;t have enough information to answer the question yet. In
addition to saying that, the identity server provides a URL to which the
user can be sent to provide the needed information and let the server
finish handling the original request.
</p>
<p>
You may invoke immediate mode when building the redirect URL to the <a
href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a> server in the <a
href="SuccessRequest.html#M000147">SuccessRequest.redirect_url</a> method.
Pass true for the <tt>immediate</tt> paramter. Read the interface for <a
href="Consumer.html#M000126">Consumer.complete</a> for information about
handling the additional response.
</p>
<h2>Using the Library</h2>
<p>
Integrating this library into an application is a relatively
straightforward process. The process usually follows this plan:
</p>
<p>
Add an <a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a> login field somewhere on your
site. When an <a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a> is entered in that field
and the form is submitted, it should make a request to the site which
includes that <a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a> URL.
</p>
<p>
When your site receives that request, it should create an <a
href="Consumer.html">OpenID::Consumer</a> instance, and call <a
href="Consumer.html#M000124">OpenID::Consumer.begin</a>. If begin completes
successfully, it will return a <a
href="SuccessRequest.html">SuccessRequest</a> object. Otherwise it will
subclass of <a href="OpenIDStatus.html">OpenIDStatus</a> which contains
additional information about the the failure.
</p>
<p>
If successful, build a redirect URL to the server by calling <a
href="SuccessRequest.html#M000147">SuccessRequest.redirect_url</a> and send
back an HTTP 302 redirect of that URL to the user&#8217;s browser. The
redirect_url accepts a return_to parameter, which is the URL to which they
will return to fininsh the <a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a> transaction.
This URL is supplied by you, and should be able to handle step 4 of the
flow described in the overview.
</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s the first half of the authentication process. The second half
of the process is done after the <a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a> server
sends the user&#8217;s browser a redirect back to your site with the
authentication response.
</p>
<p>
When that happens, the browser will make a request to the return_to URL you
provided to the <a
href="SuccessRequest.html#M000147">SuccessRequest.redirect_url</a> method.
The request will have several query parameters added to the URL by the
identity server as the information necessary to finish the request.
</p>
<p>
Your job here is to make sure that the action performed at the return_to
URL creates an instnce of <a href="Consumer.html">OpenID::Consumer</a>, and
calls the <a href="Consumer.html#M000126">Consumer.complete</a> method.
This call will return a <a href="SuccessResponse.html">SuccessResponse</a>
object, or a subclass of <a href="OpenIDStatus.html">OpenIDStatus</a>
explaining, the failure. See the documentation for <a
href="Consumer.html#M000126">Consumer.complete</a> for a full explanation
of the possible responses.
</p>
<p>
If you received a <a href="SuccessResponse.html">SuccessResponse</a>, you
may access the identity URL of the user though it&#8217;s
<tt>identity_url</tt> method.

<tt>begin</tt> is called to start the <a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a>

</p>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl>
<dt><tt>user_url</tt></dt><dd>Identity URL given by the user. <tt>begin</tt> performs a textual
transformation of the URL to try and make sure it is
&quot;normalized&quot;, for example, a user_url of example.com will be
normalized to <a href="http://example.com">example.com</a>/ normalizing and
resolving any redirects the server might issue.

</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Return Value</h2>
<p>
<tt>begin</tt> returns a subclass of <a
href="OpenIDStatus.html">OpenIDStatus</a>, which is an object that has a
<tt>status</tt> method. The status methodfor this object will either return
OpenID::SUCCESS, or OpenID::FAILURE. Generally <tt>begin</tt> will fail if
the users&#8217; <a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a> page cannot be
retrieved or <a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a> server information cannot
be determined.
</p>
<h3>Success</h3>
<p>
In the case that request.status equals OpenID::SUCCESS, the response will
be of type <a href="SuccessRequest.html">OpenID::SuccessRequest</a>. The <a
href="SuccessRequest.html">SuccessRequest</a> object may the be used to add
simple registration extension arguments, using <a
href="SuccessRequest.html#M000149">SuccessRequest.add_extension_arg</a>,
and build the redirect url to the server using <a
href="SuccessRequest.html#M000147">SuccessRequest.redirect_url</a> as
described in step 3 of the overview.
</p>
<p>
The next step in the success case is to actually build the redirect URL to
the server. Please see the documentation for <a
href="SuccessRequest.html#M000147">SuccessRequest.redirect_url</a> for
details. Once the redirect url is created, you should issue an HTTP 302
temporary redirect to the user&#8217;s browser, sending her to the <a
href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a> server. Once the user finishes the
operations on the server, she will be redirected back to the return_to URL
you passed to redirect_url, which should invoke the <a
href="Consumer.html#M000126">Consumer.complete</a> method.
</p>
<h3>Failure</h3>
<p>
If the library is unable to fetch the <tt>user_url</tt>, or no server
information can be determined, or if the server information is malformed,
<tt>begin</tt> will return a <a
href="FailureRequest.html">FailureRequest</a> object. The status method of
this object will return OpenID::FAILURE. <a
href="FailureRequest.html">FailureRequest</a> objects have a <tt>msg</tt>
method which provides more detailed information as to why the request
failed.

internally by <a href="Consumer.html#M000124">Consumer.begin</a> after
discovery is performed, and exists to provide an interface for library

Called to interpret the server&#8217;s response to an <a

</p>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl>
<dt><tt>query</tt></dt><dd>A hash of the query paramters for this HTTP request.

</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Return Value</h2>
<p>
Return value is a subclass of <a href="OpenIDStatus.html">OpenIDStatus</a>,
and may have a status of OpenID::SUCCESS, OpenID::CANCEL, OpenID::FAILURE,
or OpenID::SETUP_NEEDED. The status may be accessed through the
<tt>status</tt> method of the response object.
</p>
<p>
When OpenID::SUCCESS is returned, the response object will be of type <a
href="SuccessResponse.html">SuccessResponse</a>, which has several useful
attributes including <tt>identity_url</tt>, <tt>service</tt>, and a method
<tt>extension_response</tt> for extracting potential signed extension
reponses from the server. See the documentation for <a
href="SuccessResponse.html">OpenID::SuccessResponse</a> for more
information about it&#8217;s interface and methods.
</p>
<p>
In the case of response.status being OpenID::CANCEL, the user cancelled the
<a href="../OpenID.html">OpenID</a> transaction on the server. The response
will be an instance of <a
href="CancelResponse.html">OpenID::CancelResponse</a>, and you may access
the originally submitted identity URL and service information through that
object.
</p>
<p>
When status is OpenID::FAILURE, the object will be an instance of <a
href="FailureResponse.html">OpenID::FailureResponse</a>. If the identity
which failed can be determined it will be available by accessing the
<tt>identity_url</tt> attribute of the response. <a
href="FailureResponse.html">FailureResponse</a> objects also have a
<tt>msg</tt> attribute which may be useful in debugging. If no msg is
specified, msg will be nil.
</p>
<p>
When OpenID::SETUP_NEEDED is returned, the response object is an instance
of <a href="SetupNeededResponse.html">OpenID::SetupNeededResponse</a>. The
useful piece of information contained in this response is the
<tt>setup_url</tt> method, which should be used to send the user to the
server and log in. This response is only generated by immediate mode
requests (openid.mode=immediate). The user should be redirected in to the
<tt>setup_url</tt>, either in the current window or in a new browser
window.
